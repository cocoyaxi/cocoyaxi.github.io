## Introduction

**cocoyaxi (co for short)**, is an elegant and efficient cross-platform C++ base library. It contains a series of high-quality base components, such as **go-style coroutine**, coroutine-based network programming framework, command line and config file parser, high-performance log library, unit testing framework, JSON library, etc.

> It was said that about 23 light-years from the Earth, there is a planet named **Namake**. Namake has three suns, a large one and two small ones. The Namakians make a living by programming. They divide themselves into nine levels according to their programming level, and the three lowest levels will be sent to other planets to develop programming technology. These wandering Namakians must collect at least **10,000 stars** through a project before they can return to Namake.
> 
> Several years ago, two Namakians, [ruki](https://github.com/waruqi) and [alvin](https://github.com/idealvin), were dispatched to the Earth. In order to go back to the Namake planet as soon as possible, ruki has developed a nice build tool [xmake](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake), whose name is taken from Namake. At the same time, alvin has developed a go-style C++ coroutine library [cocoyaxi](https://github.com/idealvin/cocoyaxi), whose name is taken from the **Cocoyaxi village** where ruki and alvin live on Namake.
